# AI-Pose-Estimation-with-Python-and-MediaPipe-Plus-AI-Gym-Tracker-Project
AI powered gym tracker using AI Powered Pose estimation. You'll leverage MediaPipe and Python to detect different posts from a webcam feed. Then render the results to the screen using OpenCV. As part of it you'll also learn how to extract joint coordinates and calculate joint angles! 

1. Set up MediaPipe for Python 
2. Estimate poses using your Webcam and OpenCV
3. Extract join coordinates from the detected pose
4. Calculate angles between joints using Numpy and Trigonometry
5. Building an AI Powered Gym Tracker to count your reps
